# YOURPOS - FINAL PROJECT SUMMARY (v2)
Date: Oct 1, 2025
Status: Production-ready (external payment gateways removed)
Architecture: Next.js (App Router), React 18.3, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB/Mongoose, NextAuth

---

Project overview

YourPOS is a full-featured point-of-sale and business management system for retail and repair workflows. It includes POS checkout, inventory, repairs, reporting, authentication, and dark/light theming.

Major update: external payment providers (Braintree and PayPal) have been fully removed while preserving all other functionality and UI/UX style.

---

Technical architecture
- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.0 (App Router), React 18.3.1, Tailwind CSS 3.4.x
- Backend: Next.js API routes (Node 18+), JavaScript (ES modules)
- Database: MongoDB via Mongoose 8.x
- Auth: NextAuth 4.24.x (credentials/OAuth), authOptions sourced from lib/auth
- Reporting: jsPDF + jsPDF-AutoTable

---

What was removed (gateways)
- Braintree: all modules, API routes, UI, library and types
  - Deleted: app/api/braintree/*, components/BraintreeDropIn.tsx, lib/braintree.js, types/braintree-web-drop-in.d.ts, app/dashboard/braintree-transactions/*
  - Removed env: BRAINTREE_*
  - Removed deps: braintree, braintree-web-drop-in

- PayPal: all modules, API routes, UI and library
  - Deleted: app/api/paypal/*, lib/paypal.js
  - Cleaned UI: PaymentModal (removed PayPal button/SDK/state/types)
  - Cleaned analytics: removed PayPal-specific icons/sections
  - Removed env: PAYPAL_*, NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
  - Removed deps: @paypal/checkout-server-sdk, @paypal/paypal-server-sdk, @paypal/react-paypal-js

Results:
- No remaining Braintree/PayPal routes or code paths
- Repo-wide searches confirm zero references in source
- Builds succeed

---

Current payment methods (manual)
- Supported options everywhere (UI + models):
  - CASH
  - ONLINE
  - DEBIT_CARD
  - CREDIT_CARD
  - STORE_CREDIT (Shop Credits)

Notes:
- These are recorded manually (no external gateway processing)
- Button/validation logic in PaymentModal updated accordingly

---

Key code changes

Components/UI
- PaymentModal.tsx: simplified to the five methods above; removed PayPal state/effects/SDK
- Dashboard/Reports: removed PayPal icons/analytics; method icons now reflect cash/online/debit/credit/shop credits

APIs
- Active: auth, products, repairs, repair-categories, sales, transactions, settings
- Removed: all /api/braintree/* and /api/paypal/*
- Transactions API no longer returns PayPal fields
- Fixed: app/api/repair-categories/[id]/route.js now imports authOptions from lib/auth

Models
- Transaction.js
  - paymentMethod enum = ['CASH','ONLINE','DEBIT_CARD','CREDIT_CARD','STORE_CREDIT']
  - Removed PayPal fields: paypalOrderId, paypalCaptureId, paypalPaymentId, paypalData
  - Removed related indexes; gateway default now MANUAL

- Sale.js
  - paymentMethod enum = ['CASH','ONLINE','DEBIT_CARD','CREDIT_CARD','STORE_CREDIT']
  - Removed PayPal fields and indexes

Environment & dependencies
- Removed env: BRAINTREE_*, PAYPAL_*, NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID (left NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME)
- Removed deps: braintree, braintree-web-drop-in, @paypal/* packages
- SWC (Windows) reinstalled; prior binary warning resolved

---

Security & maintenance
- npm audit fix used with legacy peer deps; remaining advisories are upstream (Vercel toolchain) and non-blocking
- Builds are clean

---

Verification steps executed
- Uninstalled gateway packages and pruned lockfile
- Deleted gateway directories/files
- Repo-wide search ensured zero gateway references in source
- Clean builds at milestones; final build successful

---

Current API surface
- /api/auth, /api/auth/[...nextauth], /api/auth/register
- /api/products, /api/products/[id]
- /api/repairs
- /api/repair-categories, /api/repair-categories/[id]
- /api/sales, /api/sales/with-profit
- /api/transactions, /api/transactions/[id], /api/transactions/statistics
- /api/settings

Removed
- All /api/braintree/* and /api/paypal/*

---

Status summary
- Gateways: Braintree and PayPal fully decommissioned
- Payments: manual-only with 5 standardized methods
- Features retained: POS, inventory, repairs, reporting, authentication, theming
- Environment cleaned; dependencies updated; SWC fixed; builds pass

---

Next ideas (optional)
- Map ONLINE to a future provider (e.g., Stripe) with a gated feature flag
- Expand reports to present method-specific KPIs for the five methods
- Tighten npm audit items as upstream packages release patched versions
